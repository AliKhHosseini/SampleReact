# *Front End
# Change 'absolute address' to 'relative address' for TimeSlotsService.js in index.js  
# refactor HandleSelectionClick() in index.js


# *Back End
# UI should track and keep up with any changes/action by itself and send them to server just to sync the dataset. (Now server send the whole dataset back to client/UI by each action to sync UI)
# moving "initialBookedSlotTimes" values to appSetting.json
#All browsers should be synced after each change in Timeslots. (Like by using SignalR)
